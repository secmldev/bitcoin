    "#### What Is Bitcoin?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in January 2009. \n",
    "    It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n",
    "    Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms do. \n",
    "    unlike government issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.\n",
    "    Bitcoin is built on a distributed digital record called a blockchain.\n",
    "    Bitcoin trading is how you can speculate on movements in the cryptocurrency’s price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Bitcoin supply. \n",
    "    The current bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, which is expected to be exhausted by 2140. A finite supply means that the price of bitcoin could increase if demand rises in the coming years\n",
    "#### Bad press. \n",
    "    Any breaking news which concerns bitcoin’s security, value and longevity will have a negative effect on the coin’s overall market price\n",
    "#### Integration\n",
    "    Bitcoin’s public profile depends on its integration into new payment systems and banking frameworks. If this is carried out successfully, demand might rise which will have a positive effect on bitcoin’s price\n",
    "#### Key events\n",
    "    Regulation changes, security breaches and macroeconomic bitcoin announcements can all affect prices. Any agreement between users on how to speed the network up could also see confidence in bitcoin rise – pushing the price up\n"
